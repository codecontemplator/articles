our brain automatically sub divides a problem into sub problems, recursively (every animal does this to some extent - otherwise it could not survive)

if a problem cannot be sub divided we cannot solve it.

programming is about composition
the patterns of programming (think gang of four) is adhoc discovery of patterns. category theory is formalization of patterns.

1. categories, functors and natural transformations ~=~ types, functions

natural transformations ~=~ relationships between functors

2. universal construction ~=~ algebraic types

3. algebras + coalgebras ~=~ recursive types

4. monads ~=~ sideeffects
